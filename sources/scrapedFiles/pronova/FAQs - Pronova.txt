Frequently Asked Questions
General & Discovery
1. What makes PRONOVA different from other pet health products?
PRONOVA focuses on proactive and preventative pet care, providing real-time biomarker data rather than just activity levels or passive monitoring. Our Kora Strip system gives pet owners actionable insights to stay ahead of potential health problems.
2. Is this an at-home product or mail-in kit?
This is an at-home product! We have taken the technology used in lab and miniaturised it so you can be the scientist at home!
3. How do I find out more about PRONOVA’s science and research?
Our website features blog articles, case studies, and scientific overviews explaining the technology behind biosensors. You’ll also find tutorial videos and references to ongoing studies.
Website & Subscription
4. What subscription plans do you offer?
· Quarterly:
$40 per test
· Monthly:
$35 per test
· Weekly:
$25 per test
Each plan includes a supply of Kora Strips delivered to your home at the chosen frequency, plus access to the PRONOVA app.
5. Can I switch my subscription plan later?
Yes! You can switch your plan (e.g., from Quarterly to Monthly) by visiting your account on the PRONOVA website. Changes will apply to your next billing cycle.
6. Can I buy Kora Strips without a subscription?
No, as you will need to purchase the analysor to be able to run test. Single-purchase addons options are available after you activate your PRONOVA account by purchasing a subscription.
Account Creation & Checkout
7. What information do I need to create an account?
We only require your name, email address, and shipping address. Payment details are handled by Stripe during checkout, ensuring secure transactions.
8. Do you support Google or social media logins?
Not at the moment. You’ll need to create a standalone PRONOVA account using your email address.
9. Is my payment information stored on your servers?
No. Payment data is encrypted and processed by Stripe, a secure third-party payment gateway.
Shipping & Packaging
10. How fast is shipping, and how will I know my order is on the way?
We offer 2-day shipping for most orders. Once your package ships, you’ll receive an email with a tracking number to monitor its progress.
11. Why do the Kora Strips need to go in the freezer immediately?
Our biosensor technology is temperature-sensitive. Keeping the strips frozen until use ensures optimal accuracy and performance. Don’t panic if you aren’t home when the Kora Strips are delivered, they can wait a while. As soon as you can, take out the Kora Strip insert so they can sit nicely in your freezer!
12. What comes in the Kora Strip box?
· Kora Reader Device (batteries not included)
· Kora Strips (that require freezing upon delivery)
· Swabs, syringes and buffer tubes (a set of each for every Kora Strip you order)
· Quick Start Guide with detailed instructions
13. Does the Analyser need batteries?
Yes, you will need 4x AA batteries, which are not included.
App & Onboarding
14. How do I set up the PRONOVA app?
a. Download the app from the App Store or Google Play.
b. Log in using your PRONOVA credentials.
c. Follow the onboarding tutorial, which walks you through device setup, testing, and interpreting results.
15. What types of notifications does the app send?
You’ll receive push notifications reminding you when it’s time to test, along with updates on new features or product recommendations (in future releases).
16. Can I share my dog’s results with my vet through the app?
Yes! You will be able to share your test results in a PDF format that can be shared with your vet.
Testing Process
17. How do I collect saliva properly?
Use the provided swab to gently swab the inside of your dog’s mouth for about 30 seconds on each side (60 seconds total). The app offers a quick visual guide if you need help.
18. Do I need to clean the device after each test?
There is no cleaning requirement for the device because it’s not liquid-proof and shouldn’t come into contact with liquids. Keep the connector and device area dry and dust-free to maintain accuracy.
19. What if something goes wrong during testing?
You can always email our support team at support@pronovapets.com. If a Strip is damaged or the reader won’t initialize, we’ll help resolve the issue quickly.
Test Results & Biomarker Data
20. What is the Wellness Score?
After each test, the app calculates a Wellness Score (out of 100%) that reflects your dog’s overall health status based on the six measured biomarkers. This is a high-level summary of how well your pup is doing!
21. What do the biomarker ranges mean?
· Healthy Range:
Minimal risk; results are within normal limits.
· Moderate Range:
Some caution recommended; consider re-testing or monitoring closely.
· Sick Range:
Indicates a higher risk of potential health issues; consult your vet for further evaluation.
22. Can I customize the thresholds or alerts?
Not yet. We plan to personalize the biomarker thresholds based on your dog’s baseline history. Currently, the ranges are based on general canine data.
Subscription Management & Additional Purchases
23. How do I pause, cancel, or change my subscription?
All subscription changes (like switching tiers, pausing, or cancelling) can be managed through your online account on the PRONOVA website.
24. Can I buy more Kora Strips if I run out before my next shipment?
Yes! Simply log in to your account on the website to purchase additional Strips. The process is separate from your subscription order but uses the same shipping address on file.
