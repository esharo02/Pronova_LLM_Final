The American English Coonhound is a versatile and energetic breed with exceptional hunting skills and a deep connection to U.S. history.
Also known as a Redtick Coonhound, American English Coonhounds descended from European hunting dogs brought to the U.S. Here, they were refined for tracking raccoons and other game. Known for their speed, stamina, and distinctive baying voice, these dogs are highly valued by hunters and admired for their strong work ethic.
Physically, the American English Coonhound is a medium-sized dog with a sleek yet muscular build. They typically stand 23–26 inches at the shoulder and weigh 40–65 pounds.
Their short, hard coat comes in various color combinations, often including red, white, blue, and tricolor patterns. Notable for their droopy ears and expressive eyes, these hound dogs are as striking in appearance as they are capable in the field.
The American English Coonhound is a high-energy and friendly dog that thrives in active households. Affectionate and sociable, they bond closely with their family and generally get along well with strangers and other dogs when properly socialized.
Because American English Coonhounds are hunting dogs at heart, they have a strong prey drive. They may find smaller animals like rabbits and cats tempting to chase, so it’s important to supervise their interactions with small animals and keep them on a leash or inside a fenced space when they’re outside.
These hounds are loyal and playful but can display a streak of independence, so consistent training with positive reinforcement is essential. With daily exercise like long walks, jogging, or canine sports, these smart dogs can effectively channel their boundless energy and hunting instincts.
With proper care and attention, this breed makes a loving and rewarding companion for active pet parents.
The American English Coonhound is generally a healthy breed with a lifespan of 11–12 years. But like many dogs, they may be predisposed to certain genetic conditions. Regular veterinary care helps manage these risks, and it’s worth considering pet insurance to cover potential expenses.
Hip dysplasia, a common orthopedic issue in dogs, occurs when the hip joint develops abnormally, leading to instability and arthritis over time. It can cause discomfort and movement difficulties, especially in active breeds such as the American English Coonhound.
Treatment ranges from weight management, anti-inflammatory medications, and joint supplements to physical therapy or surgery in severe cases. Signs include limping, stiffness, and reluctance to climb stairs or run.
Early screening and maintaining a healthy weight can reduce the risk of hip dysplasia and improve your dog’s quality of life.
Due to their long, floppy ears, American English Coonhounds are prone to ear infections. This is because moisture and debris can get trapped in their ear canals, creating an environment for bacteria and yeast to thrive.
Regular ear cleaning with a vet-recommended ear cleaner can help prevent infections. If an infection occurs, you’ll notice symptoms including redness, odor, or headshaking. Schedule a vet appointment if you notice signs of an ear infection in your dog.
Routine ear care is an essential part of keeping this breed healthy and comfortable.
Hypothyroidism, a condition where the thyroid gland doesn’t produce enough hormones, is occasionally seen in American English Coonhounds. It can lead to symptoms such as weight gain, lethargy, dry skin, and hair loss.
This condition is typically managed with daily medication and routine blood work to monitor thyroid hormone levels. With proper treatment, dogs with hypothyroidism can live normal, healthy lives.
Progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) is an inherited eye condition that eventually causes vision loss. While there is no cure, PRA is not painful. Dogs often adapt well to reduced vision if they are in a safe and familiar environment.
Contact your vet if you see signs of PRA in your dog, including reluctance to go outside at night, increased clumsiness (such as bumping into things), dilated pupils, or cloudy eyes.
Gastric dilatation-volvulus is a severe form of bloat in dogs. It’s a life-threatening condition where the stomach fills with gas and twists, cutting off blood flow. Deep-chested breeds like the American English Coonhound are at a higher risk for this medical emergency.
Symptoms include:
Swollen, distended abdomen
Unproductive retching
Restlessness
Signs of discomfort
Excessive drooling
Dogs experiencing GDV or bloat need immediate veterinary attention; some cases may require surgery.
American English Coonhounds need high-quality nutrition to support their active lifestyle. Selecting food with the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) nutritional adequacy statement printed on the bag is an excellent way to ensure your dog receives all needed nutrients. Your vet can also help tailor your American English Coonhound’s nutrition to their specific needs.
The food must also be formulated for your dog’s life stage. Nutritional needs change with age: puppies require nutrient-dense diets, adults need balanced nutrition for activity, and seniors may benefit from joint support and fewer calories in their food.
It’s best to feed an adult American English Coonhound twice daily (morning and evening). American English Coonhound puppies need three to four smaller meals daily.
When feeding your dog, take precautions against bloat and GDV by:
Offering smaller, more frequent meals throughout the day instead of one large daily meal
Putting their food in slow-feeder bowls to help them eat slowly
Avoiding raised food bowls
Limiting exercise directly before or after your dog eats
Asking your vet about whether a gastropexy procedure, where the stomach is secured to prevent twisting, is recommended for your dog
The feeding amounts for an American English Coonhound vary based on age, weight, activity level, and life stage. Use the feeding guidelines on your dog food’s packaging as a starting point. Your vet can give you more specific guidance on how much to feed your dog.
Supplements can support the overall health of your American English Coonhound, addressing specific needs like joint health, digestion, and immune function.
Glucosamine and chondroitin promote healthy joints
Omega-3 fatty acids reduce inflammation and support a shiny coat
Antioxidants such as vitamins C and E boost immunity and protect against common health issues in senior dogs, such as cognitive dysfunction
Always talk to your vet to determine the right supplements and dosages for your dog’s unique needs. Never give your dog a supplement without speaking with your veterinarian first.
American English Coonhounds are energetic, intelligent, and independent. They need pet parents who will provide ample physical activity and mental stimulation, and the breed often requires a job or task to focus on.
While friendly and affectionate with their family, American English Coonhounds can be a bit reserved or independent at times. They tend to be good with children, though their high energy may require supervision around younger kids.
American English Coonhounds can get along well with other pets, especially if properly socialized, though their hunting instincts might make them more likely to chase smaller animals.
The biggest thing to know about American English Coonhounds is that they will follow their nose. This makes them excellent hunting dogs, but it can also get them into trouble. Always keep your Coonhound on a leash or within a fenced area whenever they spend time outside.
Their hunting instincts also show through in their frequent—and loud—bark. Traditionally, American English Coonhounds chased prey up trees and barked to alert their humans that an animal was cornered. Today, they may bark when they catch a scent to let you know a rabbit or squirrel is nearby.
Training an American English Coonhound takes patience, as their independent spirit and strong nose make them easily distracted. Use positive reinforcement methods, such as treats and praise. To manage their high energy and curiosity, training should include short, engaging sessions with mental and physical stimulation.
Begin socializing your American English Coonhound puppy as soon as you bring them home. Exposing your dog to new people, animals, and situations helps them grow into confident and well-behaved dogs.
