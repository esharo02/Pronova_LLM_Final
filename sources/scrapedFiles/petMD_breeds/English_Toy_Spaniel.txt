The English Toy Spaniel is a charming and affectionate breed known for their regal appearance and gentle demeanor.  
Originating in the 17th century, this small companion dog—often called the King Charles Spaniel in the U.K.—was bred primarily as a lap dog. King Charles II of England played a significant role in popularizing and refining the breed, rarely appearing without his cherished spaniels by his side. 
A compact toy breed (the dogs stand 9–10 inches tall and weigh 8–14 pounds), the English Toy Spaniel has a square build and a distinctive domed head with a short, upturned nose. Their large, dark eyes give them an expressive, sweet look.  
English Toy Spaniels have a long, silky coat with feathering on the ears, chest, legs, and tail. They can be found in four color varieties, each with their own formal name: 
Blenheim: chestnut and white 
Prince Charles: tricolor 
Ruby: rich mahogany red 
King Charles: black and tan  
Despite their aristocratic history, English Toy Spaniels are playful, affectionate, and deeply loyal to their pet parents. 

A gentle and affectionate companion, English Toy Spaniels make an excellent choice for those seeking a loving lap dog. This breed is known for their sweet and slightly reserved personality, and often form a strong bond with their pet parents. While friendly, they can be a bit shy around strangers and prefer a calm, predictable environment.  
English Toy Spaniels need exercise like all dogs do, but they prefer short walks and playtime before curling up on the couch. They are well-suited for apartment living. 
A unique characteristic of the English Toy Spaniel is their short, upturned nose, which gives them a signature “pushed-in” face. Though cute, this means they’re prone to breathing issues that pet parents need to be mindful of.  
In terms of grooming, the English Toy Spaniel has a long, silky coat that requires regular brushing and occasional trimming to prevent tangles and mats, especially around the ears, chest, and legs. 

The English Toy Spaniel is generally a healthy breed with an average lifespan of 10–12 years. But like all dogs, they are prone to certain health conditions. 
While not every dog will develop these issues, regular veterinary checkups are essential for early detection and management. Keep in mind that some health issues may require lifelong care, making pet insurance a worthwhile consideration to help with potential medical expenses.  
Thanks to their anatomy, English Toy Spaniels can experience brachycephalic airway syndrome (BAS), which causes breathing difficulties. Symptoms include snoring, labored breathing, and exercise intolerance. 
Pet parents caring for an English Toy Spaniel need to take certain precautions to manage the condition, including:  
Avoiding exercise in hot, humid weather 
Making sure your dog always has access to a cool, well-ventilated environment  
Monitoring for signs of respiratory distress, such as increased panting, noisy breathing, and coughing  
Severe cases may require surgery to improve your dog’s airflow.  
Mitral valve disease (MVD) is a common heart condition in small dog breeds, including the English Toy Spaniel. It occurs when the heart’s mitral valve weakens, leading to inefficient blood flow and, eventually, heart failure.  
There’s no cure, but early detection through regular vet checkups can help manage the disease, while medication and lifestyle adjustments can improve quality of life. 
Patellar luxation is when the kneecap keeps slipping out of place, which can cause lameness, a bunny-hopping gait, and discomfort.  
In mild cases, dogs may adjust on their own, but severe cases can lead to arthritis. Treatment ranges from weight management and physical therapy to surgery.  
English Toy Spaniels are prone to certain eye conditions, including cataracts and progressive retinal atrophy (PRA).  
Cataracts cause the eye to become cloudy and hinder vision, but they can be removed with surgery. PRA is a progressive disease where parts of the retina break down and lead to blindness, and there is no cure.  
Regular veterinary eye exams can help you catch both conditions early. And while there’s no cure for PRA, blind dogs can live long and happy lives with a little help from their pet parents.  
An English Toy Spaniel’s long, floppy ears can trap debris and moisture, leading to ear infections. Ear infections can also be secondary to allergies in your dog.  
Regular ear cleaning with a vet-approved ear cleanser can help prevent infections. If an ear infection occurs, symptoms may include headshaking, ear-scratching, redness, or an odor. Talk to your vet if you notice any worrying signs.  

Choosing the right food for an English Toy Spaniel is essential, but there’s no one-size-fits-all diet, says Janelle Smedley, vice president of the English Toy Spaniel Club of America (ETSCA).  
It’s best to work with your veterinarian to find the best food for your dog. The dog food should be formulated for your English Toy Spaniel’s life stage (puppy, adult, or senior) and meet the nutritional standards set by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO).  
English Toy Spaniels do best with smaller, scheduled meals rather than free-feeding or one big meal. Adult dogs benefit from twice-a-day feedings: one in the morning and one at night. English Toy Spaniel puppies benefit from more frequent meals, three to four per day, to prevent hypoglycemia. 
Their short nose makes shallow, wide food bowls ideal, and slow feeders or snuffle mats can help prevent gulping.   

 
The amount of food you should feed your dog depends on their age, activity level, weight, and health. But calorie density varies by brand, so always follow the feeding guidelines on the food packaging. 
Talking to your vet is the best way to make sure you’re feeding your dog the correct portions. Keep an eye on your English Toy Spaniel’s body condition score, and make sure they’re not gaining too much weight. Obesity in dogs can make certain health conditions, like patellar luxation and brachycephalic airway syndrome, worse.  
Most English Toy Spaniels will receive all needed nutrients through an AAFCO-compliant dog food. But for some, dog supplements might help with certain health concerns.   
Omega-3 fatty acids, or fish oil, support your dog’s skin, coat, joint, and heart health.  
Joint supplements containing glucosamine and chondroitin can help dogs with a luxating patella or arthritis.  
Taurine supports heart health, which is important for dogs predisposed to heart disease. 
Never give your dog a supplement without talking to your veterinarian first.  

The typical English Toy Spaniel personality is sweet, loving, and playful. Smedley says the breed is “a delight for those that know them,” but that “they tend to be much more selective in those they allow into their friendship circle, as opposed to their Cavalier King Charles Spaniel cousins, who tend to love everyone.” 
English Toy Spaniels often fit into any home and thrive on human contact. While they are generally not high-energy, they enjoy frequent interaction with their family, and need regular attention and affection from their pet parents. With proper socialization and introductions, they’re gentle with other dogs, cats, and children.  
The English Toy Spaniel generally has a calm and affectionate nature, but they can have some behavioral considerations to keep in mind.  
They’re not typically anxious or fearful, but English Toy Spaniels can develop separation anxiety. While crate training and offering interactive toys when you’re gone can help dogs with separation anxiety or prevent it from developing, severe cases may need help from a certified behaviorist.  
English Toy Spaniels tend to be curious and enjoy exploring their environment, but they are not known for excessive barking or digging. Some may bark to alert their pet parents of visitors, but they are generally quiet dogs.  
Early socialization is important for this breed to ensure they are comfortable around new people and animals.  
According to the ETSCA, the English Toy Spaniel dog breed is bright and eager to please. This temperament means training can be easy and fun when pet parents use patience and positive reinforcement.  
This breed thrives in basic obedience training and enjoys activities like trick training, rally, and agility. Keeping training sessions short, fun, and rewarding ensures success with this affectionate yet sometimes strong-willed breed.

English Toy Spaniels have a long, silky coat with feathering on the ears, chest, legs, and tail. While they do shed, they don’t shed as heavily as a lot of other dog breeds. Regular grooming can help cut down shedding and prevent matting, especially in the feathered areas.  
An English Toy Spaniel doesn’t have extreme skin care needs, but their smushed snout creates facial folds that require some attention. A gentle wipe-down with a dog-friendly face wipe can help prevent irritation or skin infections.  
Talk to your vet if you notice changes in your dog’s skin, such as redness or flakiness.  

Sporting a silky, medium-length coat, English Toy Spaniels require regular upkeep to stay healthy and tangle-free.  
“English Toy Spaniels … do not require professional grooming,” Smedley says. “They do require regular brushing, especially for their beautiful ears and fringe, which can mat without regular attention.”  
Brush your dog a few times a week. You may also need to occasionally trim the fur around their feet and ears as part of their upkeep.  

An English Toy Spaniel’s bulgy eyes make them prone to tear staining, which can be gently wiped away with vet-approved tear stain removers. The long, feathered hair around your dog’s face should be trimmed to prevent eye irritation.  
Always check your dog’s eyes during grooming sessions, and contact your vet if you notice changes like cloudiness or redness. Keeping up with wellness exams is another good way to catch potential eye issues early.  

Ask your vet how often you should clean your English Toy Spaniel’s ears. If your dog gets recurring ear infections, this could be a sign of allergies.  

Before bringing home an English Toy Spaniel, pet parents should know that this breed thrives in a loving, attentive environment. They make excellent companions for families or individuals who can dedicate time to bonding, grooming, and gentle and consistent training.  
An ideal home for an English Toy Spaniel is one where the dog is not left alone for long periods, as they do not thrive in isolation and can develop separation anxiety. While they aren’t high-energy, they do enjoy regular walks, mental stimulation, and daily playtime. A home with older children or other pets can work well as long as socialization is handled early. 
However, English Toy Spaniels may not do well in high-traffic, noisy environments, or with families who cannot provide enough attention and care.  
The English Toy Spaniel and the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel are different breeds, though both share a spaniel heritage. You can tell the two apart because an English Toy Spaniel has a shorter muzzle and is often smaller than a Cavalier. English Toy Spaniels also tend to be shy around new people, while Cavalier King Charles Spaniels are social butterflies. 
Yes, English Toy Spaniels make great pets. They are known for their loving and affectionate nature, and they live well alongside other pets and children. 

The cost of an English Toy Spaniel typically ranges from $1,000–$2,500, depending on factors like where you live, your chosen breeder, and your dog’s lineage.  
“This breed is fairly rare, so you cannot expect to find one in your community,” Smedley says. “The majority of breeders seem to be either in the Midwest or the East Coast. Those who own them will tell you they are worth the effort required to find one and bring it to your home. Contacting the English Toy Spaniel Club of America is the best first step to locating one of these gems.”
